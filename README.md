# **Predicting Song Popularity: Machine Learning Classification**


Music is an integral part of our daily lives. Each year, there are thousands of albums released in the national and world markets. According to the Statista Research Report, the total revenue of the music industry is forecasted to be 61.82 billion dollar globally and 22.61 billion dollar in the United States for the year 2021. The objective of this project is to utilize the "Million Song Dataset" and understand the artist's (singer) features as well the song's features that are critical for a song to be declared "popular" by the music industry. I plan to conduct an extensive data analysis to develop a machine learning (classification) model for predicting songs' popularity. The ultimate goal of the project is to build an interactive basic app, which the musicians, music lovers, sound engineers, and various other stakeholders can utilize in understanding the key features and conducting their prediction inquiries.
