# **Song Popularity Prediction: ML Classification**


Music is an integral part of our daily lives. Each year, there are thousands of albums released in the national and world markets. According to the Statista Research Report, the total revenue of the music industry is forecasted to be 61.82 billion dollar globally and 22.61 billion dollar in the United States for the year 2021. The objective of this project is to utilize an extensive dataset called the "Million Song Dataset" and understand the artist's (singer) features as well the song's features that are critical for a song to be declared "popular" by the music industry. I plan to conduct an extensive data analysis for developing a machine learning (classification) model to predict songs' popularity. The ultimate goal of the project is to build an interactive basic app, which the musicians, music lovers, sound engineers, and various other stakeholders can utilize in conducting their prediction inquiries and thereby, learning about the key features (artists' and songs') that are important for songs' popularity. 

### Business Question:
* What are the artist's features and song's features that determine songs' popularity in the music industry?
* Which machine learning model can best simulate the key features (artists' and songs') in predicting songs’ popularity with high accuracy?  

### Data Collection
The dataset to be analyzed for the model prediction is called “Million Song Dataset” (MSD). It is a collection of metadata for a million contemporary music tracks from 1921 to 2011. MSD started as a collaborative project between the Echo Nest (now owned by Spotify) and LabROSA of Columbia University. The original dataset was in the HDF5 format, which later has been transformed into the CSV format. Important links for the MSD dataset are provided below:
