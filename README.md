# **Song Popularity Prediction: ML Classification**


Music is an integral part of our daily lives. Each year, there are thousands of albums are released in the national and world markets. According to the Statista Research Report, the total revenue of the music industry is forecasted to be 61.82 billion dollar globally and 22.61 billion dollar in the United States for the year 2021. The objective of this project is to build an interactive app, which the musicians, music lovers, sound engineers, and various other stakeholders can utilize in conducting songs' popularity prediction and thereby, understanding an artist's (singer's) features as well as a song's features that are critical for the song to be declared "popular" by the music industry. The powerful entities of the music industry such as Spotify, MusicBrainz, Echo Nest, and so forth have defined a set of artist's and song's feature indices in the “Million Song Dataset” (MSD). In order to build the interactive app, I have conducted an extensive data analsis of the MSD feature indices and incorporated them in developing a machine learning classification model for song's popularity prediction. In brief, the business questions of this project are as follows:

### Business Questions:
* What are the artist's features and song's features that determine songs' popularity in the music industry?
* Which machine learning model can best simulate the artists' features and songs' features in predicting songs’ popularity with higher accuracy?  

### Data Collection
The MSD dataset is a collection of metadata of a million contemporary music tracks from 1920 to 2010. It started as a collaborative project between the Echo Nest (now owned by Spotify) and LabROSA of Columbia University. The original dataset contains ............................
